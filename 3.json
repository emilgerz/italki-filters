Thank you for being cooperative! \n授業が始まる前に、現在の言語レベル及び学習目標をitalkiメッセンジャーにてお教え頂ければ幸いです。 \n請在課程開始前通過italki的私信告知您當前的語言水平和學習目標。多謝合作！\n\n～this lesson is only for general language learning～\n\nIn this class, I will tutor you with your Japanese learning comprehensively from all aspects which you are working on, including listening, speaking, grammar, vocabulary, and business Japanese. It would be better if you’ve already had any fundamentals of the Japanese language. This session also covers the preparation contents for the JLPT Test.  I can help you get the best score as you expect. Please let me know what you are expecting from our lessons in advance.\n\nI am a native American English speaker from California, the United States of America and I've lived in Japan for 9 years before I moved to Germany in 2020. Currently, I’m working as an Urban Economist and Data scientist in Germany and I operate my own data analytic solution company in Japan as an executive director.\n\nAs for my qualifications related to Japanese, I've accomplished my JLPT(Japanese Language Proficiency Test) N1 with full marks (180/180) in 2014 and received my official Japanese Teaching Certificate from the Japanese Government in 2017. In 2019, I was also granted the Official Japanese Kanji Educator accredited by Japan Kanji Aptitude Testing Foundation.\n\nI was working at one of the biggest Japanese Research Institutes as a finance analyst and researcher for 2 years, and at a Japanese TV station as an Eng-Chn-Jpn translator for 1 year.",
