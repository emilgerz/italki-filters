        "about_teacher": "Around 10 years ago, I switched to one-to-one English tutoring and coaching as I found it more rewarding than classroom teaching.  In this setting, I can identify more clearly individual needs and modify the course accordingly. It's great to see students make more progress as a result.  Outside lesson time, I enjoy preparing materials for my students. At the moment, for instance, I am writing a short story with accompanying audio to help students with their English.",
        "teaching_style": "In my lessons I always try to strike a balance between enjoyment on the one hand and solid progress on the other.  In a typical conversation course, for instance, as we have an enjoyable chat based on topics I think you will find interesting, I will make a note of new or forgotten words, expressions and collocations, issues with pronunciation and intonation, as well as any unnatural phrasing or grammar mistake.  After the lesson, I send you these notes and they form the basis of homework exercises and tests if you have requested them.  I may also send you specific grammar exercises and recordings to help you make more progress.",

I am a TEFL Certified teacher with more than 15 years of experience.\nI currently live in Cape Town, I have been here all my life and I teach English at a private nursery.\nI have explored South Africa and lots of areas within our country, but there is so much still to see and I have a wish list to visit other countries later on. \nMy main hobby is arts (my personal favorite) but I also thoroughly enjoy reading, cycling and socializing.\nLiving beside the sea lets me enjoy the outdoor lifestyle and I love spending time camping in the surrounding area.",
        "about_teacher": "I studied Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) a few years ago and started teaching about 15 years ago to 2 to 8-year-olds at a private creche.\nI also teach private lessons to advanced students to improve their grammar, vocabulary and conversational skills but I have always enjoyed the beginners more and love watching a student gain satisfaction from learning new language skills.",
        "teaching_style": "I like using general words, phrases and other things that you see or use on a daily basis, as it is a great way to start, for example, parts of the body, animals, actions, etc. Depending on the level of students a lesson plan will be created to suit their needs. I sometimes give homework to be completed and feedback will be given at the end of each lesson. I will use flashcards, books, and activity sheets and most importantly I will try and make each class fun, enjoyable and relaxing.\nFor advanced students, I will discuss hobbies and interests that feel comfortable to hold a conversation and advance as we move forward.",

        "about_me": "My name is Gabriel. I grew up in Mexico City, but in February of 2020 I moved to London. I got my BA with honours in International Relations in Mexico. Then, I lived in Wales in 2011 and 2012 when I got my Masters Degree by Research in Media Culture and Communication, and I also lived for 9 months in Chicago, Illinois, and Columbus, Ohio; so I am fluent in English and Spanish. I enjoy international experiences and diverse cultures, and I have also visited almost 30 countries, maybe even yours. I am improving my French, so I understand what it feels like to learn another language; and now I'm ready and happy to help you learn too.",
        "about_teacher": "Since 2015 I have taught full time to students from 13 to 65 years of age, from basic academic skills to advanced business levels (for companies like Amazon, LinkedIn, Burger King and Walmart), and to people from all continents; always adapting to their needs. I got my certification as a foreign language teacher from the National Autonomous University of Mexico in 2019. I can switch from English to Spanish or vice versa if needed (but I generally prefer only to speak in the language I teach), and I can also support with different accents, formal expressions or slang. I have helped others presenting international certifications such as the IELTS, TOEFL and USA and Mexico citizenship.",
        "teaching_style": "If my student wants enjoyable lessons with fun activities and a natural technique, I'm ready to help. I see myself more as a guide than a teacher because the most important thing for me is that my students improve by learning to learn. Generally, in the first lessons, I identify the learning needs of my students, and later we work with suitable activities. \nWe use images, songs, magazine articles, social media, videos, poems, comics, games and free exercises to focus on their goals. If they want help with school homework, or to make friends in trips, or to grow professionally, I'll be there. We can talk about anything, like art, movies, books, friends, news, food, sports or journeys.",

        "introduction": "Hi! Thanks for looking at my profile!\n\nMy name is Andrew, I am a native English speaker from Sheffield in England. I am a TEFL qualified professional English teacher, and have been teaching English, both online and in classrooms since 2013. On italki alone I have successfully taught over 2000 lessons to students from various backgrounds and abilities with different learning requirements.\n\n For the past 4 years I having been teaching English, first in Taiwan and now in the Philippines, so I understand the challenges of both learning a foreign language, and developing the confidence to use it. My lessons are always personalised to suit your needs! Here is a short explanation of the lessons I offer:\n\nStructured Practical English Lessons. These lessons primarily make use of a slideshow based lesson plan, which helps you to understand various aspects of the English language. If you need help to understand how to accurately use prepositions, articles, tenses, phrasal verbs, idioms and other rules of the English language, this is the course for you!\n\nEnglish Conversation: Do you need to practice and improve your conversation skills? In this class we will do exactly that. I use various audio clips and videos in these lessons to keep them varied and interesting. I will also correct the mistakes you make.\n\nIELTS Speaking and Writing lessons: I have helped many students prepare for IELTS. For these lessons we use a combination of slideshow based information and practice test questions to really work on improving your IELTS scores. Many of my students have improved by 0.5 to 1.0 in IELTS with just a few lessons. Some have even reached scores of 8.5 with a little more work.\n\nPlease feel free to ask any questions you many have!\n\n\n RESCHEDULING POLICY. If you find out that you can't attend a lesson within 24 hours of the scheduled time, please let me know as soon as possible. If you don't inform me or forget about the lesson, I expect it to be marked 'completed'. Thanks.",

Do things that are fun for you.\nAs a teacher I will share with you my knowledge, but as a fellow language learner, I will share my experience about learning.\n\n英語も日本語も独学で覚えてきたから、誰でも外国語が話せるようになれると信じます。\n秘訣はただ１つ：毎日少しでも頑張って、お楽しみに勉強することです。\n先生として、知識を提供します。言語学習者同士として、自分の経験やコツを提供します。",
        "teaching_style": "Skype, Google, italki Classroom, Zoom or Discord are ok.\nIf you prefer Discord, book for Skype and send me your ID in the message.\n\nDuring classes, conversation is the main ingredient, using pictures and other media to help when needed.\nAfter class, you will be given homework that I will correct and explain to you. I do my best to make it entertaining!\nSome students enjoy learning grammar or pronunciation in more detail. For them I can go way more in-depth if asked.\n(Japanese classes are more homework-heavy, as the writing system requires a lot of time to learn)\n\n授業は会話が中心になります。絵・動画などで話題や活動も作られます。\n授業後、宿題を出して、添削や難点の説明します。楽しい課題を作るように頑張ります！\n文法や発音の細かい部分に興味を持っている生徒たちには、もちろん、きちんと教えられる、ぜひ聞いてください！",

          "description": "I am a native Ukrainian and Russian speaker and I learned English as my 3rd language. Knowing how to speak a language and having the ability to \"teach\" a language are two absolutely different things. Since I am not a native speaker of English, I have come through a lot of difficulties and I know how hard it can be sometimes. That is why I can help you overcome your struggles. \n\nThe purpose of this lesson is to get you out of your comfort zone and help you actually \"speak\" the language and furthermore \"enjoy\" the process. \n\nYou can choose whatever topic you are interested in the most, we will discuss vocabulary and some expressions. If you have any questions related to grammar, you are always free to ask me. But our main goal will be set on speaking and enriching your vocabulary list. \n\nI can easily adapt to your needs, methods and pace. Also I am very patient with my students. I will repeat and explain things as many times as you want me to, until you fully understand. See you at our lesson!\n\n[NOTICE]\n\n🍀Please be aware that booking a lesson is a promise between a teacher and a student. \n🍀Rescheduling or cancelling are only available 24 hours before the lesson starts (like it is written in the Italki rules and system). \n🍀Otherwise, the lesson will be confirmed and the credit will be transferred to a tutor. \n🍀Please, respect teacher's time, the same as a teacher respects student's time, because a teacher could have had another class at the booked hour.

I'll spend the booked time on finishing the task that you asked me to do. \n\nBEFORE BOOKING THIS CLASS please contact me and explain what exactly you want me to do, what app/programme you want me to use and what is the approximate amount of work.\n\n[NOTICE]\n\n🍀Please be aware that booking a lesson is a promise (обіцянка) between a teacher and a student. \n🍀Rescheduling or cancelling are only available 24 hours before the lesson starts (like it is written in the Italki rules and system)",
